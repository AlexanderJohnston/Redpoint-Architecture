# Redpoint-Architecture

Warning: Large images.

This contains examples of my data Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) experience. These tools are automated and mapped out visually to show you the scope of just one automation.

Each node is a single function. Each line represents a path for data to be piped to the next function. This language is not object oriented.

Each example is an image file which has the entire arichtecture for one single automation visualized. These automations run the majority of our day to day operations.
